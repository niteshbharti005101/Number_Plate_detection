India faces a lot of issues related to tarffics and parkings in any particular locality. It has therefore also become a huge responsibility to minimise power consumption and wastage to promote an efficient energy usage method. One such example of enormous power consumption is due to street lights or light poles. In the world, several trillion kWh are expended on street lighting annually ergo billing of street lights is a huge penalty. 
for us to come up with a solution where this work can be done easily and effectively. The number plate detection works on the basis of detection the
number of any vehicle, it's color and other relevant information related to it. Futher it will seach for the number in it's datbase and if the number is already present in the
datebase of it, it will show the details of it such as owner name, addres, liscence number. Further it will check for the parking area assigned to
it and opens up the gate for him to park it before reaching to the parking place. It would also search whether the parking area is occupied by some other
vehicle or so. If the case falls on this, it will immediately intimate about this to the owner of that vehicle to remove his vehicle from 
the other person's parking area.
